  <p>
  I am a fifth (and final) year PhD student in Bioengineering at the University of Pennsylvania, advised by 
  <a href="https://vitalelab.med.upenn.edu/dr-flavia-vitale-bio/" target="_blank"> Dr. Flavia Vitale </a>,
  in the <a href="https://cnt.upenn.edu/" target="_blank"> Center for Neuroengineering and Therapeutics </a>.
  My research interests revolve around computational neuroscience and deep learning.
  </p>
  I am currently developing robust neural decoders for humans implanted with
  stereotactic EEG (sEEG). Currently, neural decoders based on sEEG are patient-specific, which is expensive, 
  cumbersome, and does not scale. To combat this, I am leveraging 
  the versatility of transformers to create unified models that generalize across patients, despite the number and 
  placement of electrodes in their brain. This approach enables combining datasets collected across multiple 
  patients and medical centers, to train more expressive models on orders of magnitude more data. The goal of this work 
  is to enable high-performance, scalable, and cheap neural decoding from sEEG.      
  </p>
  <p>
  I am also working on energy efficient neural decoders for microelectrode array based brain computer interfaces (BCIs).
  BCIs have revolutionized the quality of life of paralyzed patients by enabling them to control computers with their
  thoughts, ultimately restoring their digital freedom. While extremely helpful, most BCIs rely on artificial neural
  networks (ANNs) that are power hungry, requiring users to recharge their BCI every few hours, which is impractical and 
  frustrating. To combat this, we are developing decoders based on spiking neural networks, which are 
  very energy efficient compared to ANNs. The goal of this work is to enable BCI users to utilize their device without
  the frustrating need for frequent recharging.
  </p>
  <p>    
  Overall, I aspire to use my skills and experience to advance the interface of human and artificial intelligence to
  ultimately restore the quality of life of those suffering from neurological disorders.
