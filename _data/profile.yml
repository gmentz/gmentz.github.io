  <p>

  I am a fifth (and final) year Bioengineering PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania, advised by Dr. Flavia
  Vitale, in the Center for Neuroengineering and Therapeutics. My research interests revolve around computational 
  neuroscience and deep learning. Throughout the years, I have obtained extensive experience working with big datasets
  and developing deep learning frameworks with applications in healthcare.
  
  </p>
  
  I am currently working on developing robust neural decoders for humans implanted with
  stereotactic EEG (sEEG). Currently, neural decoders based on sEEG are patient-specific. However, 
  developing patient-specific decoders is expensive, cumbersome, and does not scale because patient-specific data
  are limited. To combat this, I am leveraging the versatility of transformers to create unified models
  that generalize across patients, despite the number and placement of sEEG electrodes in 
  their brain. This unified multi-subject approach enables the accumulation of datasets collected across multiple 
  patients and medical centers, to train more expressive models on orders of magnitude more data. Such unified models 
  outperform patient-specific models and can easily be transferred to new patients. The goal of this work is to enable
  high-performance, scalable, and cheap neural decoding from sEEG.
  
  <p>
  
  I am also working on developing energy efficient neural decoders for patients implanted with microelectrode array 
  based brain computer interfaces (BCIs). Currently, BCIs have enabled paralyzed individuals to control their phone and 
  computer with their thoughts, revolutionizing patient care for those with neurological disorders. While extremely 
  helpful, those BCIs rely on artificial neural networks (ANNs) that are power hungry, requiring users to recharge their BCIs 
  every few hours, limiting their practicality and usability. To eliminate the need for frequent charging, 
  we are developing neural decoding models based on spiking neural networks (SNNs), which are very energy efficient 
  compared to ANNs, especially when deployed on neuromorphic hardware. The goal of this work is to enable patients 
  implanted with BCIs to use their device throughout the day without the frustrating need for frequent recharging.
  
  </p>
  
  Overall, I aspire to use my skills and experience to advance the interface of human and artificial intelligence to
  ultimately restore the quality of life of those suffering from neurological disorders.
